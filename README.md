# mk8d-build-stats

This is a simple project to enumerate all unique builds (character + vehicle + tire + glider) in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and their associated stats.

For easier interactivity, I uploaded `all-build-stats.csv` to [Google Sheets here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1knIDHKJcCPZ-71PvGuluQ84E8XmQtKjU3p3VozLy3_k/edit?usp=sharing).

Fun fact: There are 23,868 rows of data in `all-build-stats.csv`.

The source data is from [Luigi_Fan2's Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Stat Chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g7A-38tn9UAIbB2B3sZI-MpILsS3ZS870UTVMRRxh4Q/edit#gid=0), found via [Tobias Mattsson's Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Builder](https://mk8dxbuilder.com).
